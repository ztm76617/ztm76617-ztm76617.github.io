My name is Zachary Thomas McDowell.

I earned both my BA and MA in Political Science from the University of Georgia. This website exists to host my various professional materials and documents associated with both past and ongoing research projects.

My research interests involve the following:

-   Time-Series Econometrics
-   International & Comparative Political Economy
-   The Politics of Income Inequality & Redistribution
-   The Causes and Consequences of Economic Crises
-   Cross-National Trends in Capital Investment

I've included a number of academic articles and books on the "Influential Readings" page to provide an overview of the types of research that I regularly engage with.
